##### What's your proudest achievement? 
* It can be a personal project or something you've worked on professionally. 
* Just a short paragraph is fine, but I'd love to know why you're proud of it, 
* what impact it had (If any) and any insights you took from it.

My proudest achievement is a data analysis platform I've designed, architected and implemented at work.
It uses new technologies that I had to learn almost from scratch, with new concepts I haven't seen before.

The main reason I'm proud of it is because it was a complex project, with a huge number of disparate technologies in its stack.
I worked on it alone, as part of an R&D initiative, I was involved from the requirements gathering to its deployment, as well as sharing
knowledge about how to use it, to its users, and how to implement requirements in it, to the team members new to it.

The main impact it had so far is, that nothing is easy, and even if you aim for perfection there will always be small
details remaining, and there will always be room for improvement. But even so I had fun working on it, which is important.

It encourages me to keep pushing the envelope in my own (soft and hard) skills.
